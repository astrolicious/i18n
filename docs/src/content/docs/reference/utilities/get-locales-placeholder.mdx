title: getLocalesPlaceholder
---

Allows you to get the locales inside of `getStaticPaths`. It's a build time macro.
That means it will be replaced by it's literal value. For instance:

```astro
---
import { getLocalesPlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locales = getLocalesPlaceholder()

    return []
}
---
```

Will be replaced by the following, no matter the context:

```astro {5}
---
import { getLocalesPlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locales = ["en", "fr"]

    return []
}
---
```

Be careful not to use `getLocalesPlaceholder` in interpolations or it could result in invalid code.
