Below are the currently known issues and limitations (but they're probably more!):

## Rest parameters

Translating rest parameters in your integration config `pages` option and using it with
`getLocalePath` and `switchLocalePath` **has not been tested yet**. Note that this is planned
and will be tackled soon.

## Sitemap

The official sitemap integration works but is not optimally integrated. The alternate links won't
be generated for different paths (eg. `/about`, `/fr/a-propos`). **This is being worked on**.

## Starlight

Usage in **Starlight** has not been tested but is not recommended, as it has its own i18n system.
