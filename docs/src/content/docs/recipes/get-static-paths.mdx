title: getStaticPaths
---

`getStaticPaths` is a bit special in Astro. On one hand it's absolutely necessary for dynamic SSG
routes but it runs before everything, even middlewares.

Under the hood, the package uses a middleware so we can't access any of the standard utilities inside
of `getStaticPaths`. Instead, we provide placeholder functions that are build time macros: `getLocalePlaceholder`,
`getLocalesPlaceholder` and `getDefaultLocalePlaceholder`.
That means it will be replaced by it's literal value. For instance:

```astro
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder, getLocalesPlaceholder, getDefaultLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = getLocalePlaceholder()
    const defaultLocale = getDefaultLocalePlaceholder()
    const locales = getLocalesPlaceholder()

    return []
}
---
```

Will be replaced by the following, no matter the context:

```astro {5}
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder, getLocalesPlaceholder, getDefaultLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = "en"
    const defaultLocale = "en"
    const locales = ["en", "fr"]

    return []
}
---
```

Be careful not to use these functions in interpolations or it could result in invalid code.
