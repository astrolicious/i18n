title: getStaticPaths
---

`getStaticPaths` is a bit special in Astro. On one hand it's absolutely necessary for dynamic SSG
routes but it runs before everything, even middlewares.

Under the hood, the package uses a middleware so we can't access any of the standard utilities inside
of `getStaticPaths`. Instead, we provide `getLocalePlaceholder` and `getDefaultLocalePlaceholder` function that is a build time macro.
That means it will be replaced by it's literal value. For instance:

```astro
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder, getDefaultLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = getLocalePlaceholder()
    const defaultLocale = getDefaultLocalePlaceholder()

    return []
}
---
```

Will be replaced by the following, no matter the context:

```astro {5}
---
import { getLocalePlaceholder, getDefaultLocalePlaceholder } from "i18n:astro"

export const getStaticPaths = () => {
    const locale = "en"
    const defaultLocale = "en"

    return []
}
---
```

Be careful not to use `getLocalePlaceholder` or `getDefaultLocalePlaceholder` in interpolations or it could result in invalid code.
