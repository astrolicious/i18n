Accessibility, often referred to as a11y, is a cornerstone of modern web design that guarantees digital products can be used by people of all abilities. By following accessibility best practices—such as providing sufficient color contrast, using semantic HTML, and ensuring keyboard navigation—designers and developers create inclusive experiences that benefit everyone. Prioritizing accessibility not only meets legal requirements but also demonstrates social responsibility, enhances usability, and expands the potential audience. Ultimately, accessible design isn’t just about compliance; it’s about respecting users and creating digital spaces where all people can thrive.
