Localization, or l10n, goes beyond simple translation by adapting content, visuals, and functionality to reflect local cultural norms and expectations. Effective localization makes users feel that the product was created specifically for them, which strengthens trust and drives engagement. From formatting dates and currencies to adjusting imagery and tone, l10n enhances the user experience in meaningful ways. Companies that invest in localization not only boost customer satisfaction but also gain a competitive edge in global markets.
