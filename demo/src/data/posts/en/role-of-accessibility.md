Accessibility, or a11y, ensures that digital products are inclusive and usable by people with diverse abilities. By adopting accessibility standards such as WCAG, designers and developers can create experiences that are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users. Beyond meeting legal requirements, prioritizing a11y demonstrates social responsibility, improves overall usability, and enhances brand reputation. Accessibility is not just a feature — it’s a foundation of great design.
